A Minecraft Fabric mod that broadcasts your in-game death count (on a per-server basis) over your local network using UDP.

You might ask "Why would you want to do that?" which is a totally valid question... Well... You see, I designed a real-life physical Minecraft death counter! There was only one problem, the counter had no way of knowing how many times I have died, and I am way too lazy to manually increment it!

Currently the counter consists of 2x custom 7-segment displays made by 3D-printing covers for short strips I cut off from an LED strip. I'll have to add another digit soon if I keep dying at the rate that I currently am... and the project is not even functional yet!
